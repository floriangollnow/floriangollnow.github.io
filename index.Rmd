I am interested in research questions at the intersection of nature conservation, agricultural production, and livelihoods. Currently, I investigate the role of zero-deforestation commitments in the Brazilian soybean sector, using econometric modeling and large spatial and temporal data.  
My work focuses predominantly on understanding causes and the spatio-temporal dynamics of land-use changes to contribute to policy making and to a better understanding of human-environmental interactions.   
  
I received my Ph.D. from [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en) where I investigated spatio-temporal interactions of land-use change (i.e., soybean and cattle ranching), environmental policies, and tropical deforestation in Brazil. Following, I was awarded a two-year Postdoctoral-Fellowship at the [Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/), University of Maryland. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/earth/), working in collaboration with the [Environmental Policy Lab (EPL) at ETH Zürich](https://epl.ethz.ch/).

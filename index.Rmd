I am interested in research questions at the intersection of nature conservation, agricultural production, and livelihoods. Currently, I investigate the role of zero-deforestation commitments in the Brazilian soybean sector, using econometric modeling and large spatial and temporal data.  
More general, my work focuses on understanding causes and the spatio-temporal dynamics of land-use changes to contribute to policy making and a better understanding of environmental change.   
  
I received my Ph.D. from [Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/de) where I investigated spatio-temporal interactions of land-use change (i.e., soybean and cattle ranching), environmental policies, and tropical deforestation in Brazil. Following, I was awarded a two-year Postdoctoral-Fellowship at the [Socio-Environmnetal Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/). Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/earth/), working in collaboration with the [Environmental Policy Lab (EPL) at ETH Zurich](https://epl.ethz.ch/).

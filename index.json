Sustainable intensification in areas of high yield gaps has been proposed a pathway to achieve food security, support rural livelihoods, while also reducing the impact of commodity production by narrowing yield gaps on existing agricultural lands, while improving resource efficiency. Following the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Georgia experienced one of the highest losses of agricultural productivity among all former USSR countries and is now highly dependent on food imports. Closing yield gaps in Georgia through sustainable intensification has the potential to increase food self-sufficiency, support rural livelihoods, and strengthen food security and sovereignty. We estimated its potential for sustainable intensification in current agricultural areas to achieve self-sufficiency for wheat, maize, and barley. We found that crop yields can be doubled to tripled under high-input production systems, using high-yielding varieties, optimized inputs, fertilizers, and pest control. Yet, self-sufficiency in wheat can only be reached if at least 80% of the potentially attainable yields are achieved and if land is strategically allocated between crops. To achieve such increases, farmers need access to and training for using different crop varieties, fertilizers, and pest and disease control practices and products. Intensification increases the risks to ecosystem services' health and livelihoods, particularly raising equity concerns. Yet, intensifying very low input systems is often found to be more sustainable, with high yield increases compared to limited impacts on the environment. The high employment rate in the agricultural sector in Georgia particularly provides opportunities to reduce poverty and increase livelihoods through increasing incomes and food security.","tags":["LULCC"],"title":"Georgia's potentials for sustainable intensification, increasing food security and rural incomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Levers","Maria Piquer-Rodriguez","Florian Gollnow","Matthias Baumann","Micaela Camino","Néstor Ignacio Gasparri","Gregorio Ignacio Gavier-Pizarro","Yann le Polain de Waroux","Daniel Müller","Javier Nori","Florian Pötzschner","Alfredo Romero-Muñoz","Tobias Kuemmerle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1714348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714348800,"objectID":"10f13a9d5cd393d7c83fced70a5eb041","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/levers_et_al_2024/","publishdate":"2024-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/levers_et_al_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Commodity agriculture continues to spread into tropical dry forests globally, eroding their social-ecological integrity. Understanding where deforestation frontiers expand, and which impacts this process triggers, is thus important for sustainability planning. We reconstructed past land-system change (1985-2015) and simulated alternative land-system futures (2015-2045) for the Gran Chaco, a 1.1 million km² global deforestation hotspot with high biological and cultural diversity. We co-developed nine plausible future land-system scenarios, consisting of three contrasting policy narratives (Agribusiness, Ecomodernism, and Integration) and three agricultural expansion rates (high, medium, and low). We assessed the social-ecological impacts of our scenarios by comparing them with current biodiversity, carbon density, and areas used by forest-dependent people. Our analyses revealed four major insights. First, intensified agriculture and mosaics of agriculture and remaining natural vegetation have replaced large swaths of woodland since 1985. Second, simulated land-system futures until 2045 revealed potential hotspots of natural vegetation loss (e.g. western and southern Argentinian Chaco, western Paraguayan Chaco), both due to the continued expansion of existing agricultural frontiers and the emergence of new ones. Third, the strongest social-ecological impacts were consistently connected to the Agribusiness scenarios, while impacts were lower for the Ecomodernism and Integration scenarios. Scenarios based on our Integration narrative led to lower social impacts, while Ecomodernism had lower ecological impacts. Fourth, comparing recent land change with our simulations showed that 10 % of the Chaco is on a pathway consistent with our Agribusiness narrative, associated with adverse social-ecological impacts. Our results highlight that much is still at stake in the Chaco. Stricter land-use and conservation planning are urgently needed to avoid adverse social-ecological outcomes, and our results charting the option space of plausible land-system futures can support such planning.","tags":["LULCC"],"title":"What is still at stake in the Gran Chaco?

In the country of Georgia, at the heart of the Caucasus region, forest degradation has been the largest land change process over the last thirty years. The prevailing narrative is that legal and illegal cutting of trees for fuelwood is primarily responsible for this process. Yet, since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the country has undergone rapid socioeconomic and institutional changes which have not been explored as drivers of forest change. We combine newly available land-cover change estimates, Georgian statistical data, and historical institutional change data to examine socioeconomic drivers of forest degradation. Our analysis controls for concurrent changes in climate that would affect degradation and examines variation at the regional (state) level from 2011 to 2019, as well as at the national level from 1987 to 2019. We find that higher winter temperature and drought are associated with higher degradation at the regional scale, while major institutional changes and drought are associated with higher forest degradation at the national level. Access to natural gas, the major energy alternative to fuelwood, had no significant association with degradation. Our results challenge the narrative that poverty and a lack of alternative energy infrastructure drive forest degradation and suggest that government policies banning household fuelwood cutting, including the new Forest Code of 2020, may not reduce forest degradation. Given these results, improved data on wood harvesting and more research on the commercial drivers of degradation and their links to economic and political reforms is needed to better inform forest policy in the region, especially given ongoing risks from climate change.","tags":["LULCC"],"title":"Exploring natural and social drivers of forest degradation in post-Soviet Georgia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Gollnow","Federico Cammelli","Kimberly Carlson","Rachael Garrett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664928000,"objectID":"e2fe626f39cf36264fac05c743ad1cdc","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/gollnow_et_al_2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gollnow_et_al_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Tropical deforestation continues despite global efforts to curb forest loss. Corporate zero-deforestation supply chain commitments (ZDCs) have the potential to address this deforestation, especially if strong state-led forest governance is absent. Yet, because ZDC adoption is limited to particular locations and supply chains, these commitments may fall short at reducing regional deforestation and protecting biodiverse ecosystems. Here, we leverage timeseries of spatially explicit corporate commodity sourcing data and ZDC commitments to assess the current and potential effect of ZDCs within soybean supply chains on forest loss and biodiversity. We focus on the Brazilian Amazon, where the first ZDC (Soy Moratorium) was implemented, and the Cerrado, where companies have adopted but not implemented ZDCs. We found that in the Amazon, Soy Moratorium signatories that controlled the market caused a 57% reduction in direct deforestation for soy from 2006 to 2015. In the Cerrado, if companies had implemented their ZDCs with the same relative effectiveness as in the Amazon, deforestation for soy could have been reduced by 46%. Thus, ZDC implementation in the Cerrado via stringent monitoring and enforcement could contribute substantially to forest and habitat conservation. Yet, incomplete ZDC adoption leaves \u003e50% of soy-suitable forests and the biodiversity that they harbor outside the reach of ZDCs. To protect these forests, it is vital to incentivize more companies – including smaller, less publicly exposed traders - to make and implement ZDCs, while also promoting forest governance through public policy.","tags":["ZDC"],"title":"Gaps in adoption and implementation limit the current and potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation supply chain policies for soy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nelson Villoria","Rachael Garrett","Florian Gollnow","Kimberly Carlson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663372800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663372800,"objectID":"373b2b48f4d470af9cf2ca18e175b8cb","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/nelson_et_al_2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nelson_et_al_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Zero-deforestation supply chain policies that leverage the market power of commodity buyers to change agricultural producer behavior can reduce forest clearing in regions with rapid commodity expansion and weak forest governance.

However, cross-border leakage is insignificant (\u003c3%) because soybean production is displaced to existing U.S. farmland. Eliminating deforestation from the supply chains of all firms exporting Brazilian soy to the EU or China from 2011-2016 could have reduced net global deforestation by 2% and Brazilian deforestation by 9%.

While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, costeffective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable developement that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.","tags":["ZDC"],"title":"Should payments for environmental services be used to implement zero deforestation supply chain policies?

Public interest and support are required to maximize the effectiveness of policies to combat the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks of zoonoses. Here, we use internet search data from the United States to investigate changes in public information seeking about topics at the intersection of health and the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using breakpoint detection methods, we identify sharp increases in interest for ‘wildlife trade’, ‘bats’, and ‘pangolins’ in the early stages of the pandemic (on Jan. 12, Jan. 19, and Jan. 26, 2020, respectively). Network analyses also revealed increasing connectivity between terms related to human health and the environment, as well as the emergence of novel search terms pointing to a greater interest in wildlife trade and consumption. During the pandemic, the network connectivity between coronavirus keywords and conservation keywords increased, which we measured using the number of unique connections (edge connectivity, k′ (G)) and the number of simple paths (Sp) between keywords. Both measures of network connectivity increased between ‘coronavirus’ and ‘bats’ or ‘pangolins’ (Δk′ (G) = 1, ΔSp = 37), and between ‘coronavirus’ and ‘conservation’ (Δk′ (G) = 1, ΔSp = 160). These findings suggest that policy and outreach efforts aimed at engaging public interest in intersectional approaches to pandemic prevention (e.g., One Health, Planetary Health), may be able to take advantage of increases in public information seeking following catalyzing events during the pandemic. Further monitoring is needed to determine if these changes persist over time.","tags":["Other"],"title":"Using internet search data to understand information seeking behavior for health and conservation topics during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Evidence Enoguanbhor","Florian Gollnow","Blake Walker","Jonas Nielson","Tobia Lakes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616284800,"objectID":"c6a5d24dc7fffcd69944f0fcf87be8dc","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/evidence_et_al_2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evidence_et_al_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Land use planning as strategic instruments to guide urban dynamics faces particular challenges in the Global South, including Sub-Saharan Africa, where urgent interventions are required to improve urban and environmental sustainability.

In doing so, we combined expert interviews and questionnaires with spatial analyses of urban and regional land use plans, as well as current and future urban land cover maps derived from Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing. By overlaying and contrasting land use plans and land cover maps, we investigated spatial inconsistencies between urban and regional plans and the associated urban land dynamics and used expert surveys to identify the causes of such inconsistencies. We furthermore identified and interrogated key challenges facing land use planning, including its environmental assessment procedures, and explored means for overcoming these barriers to rapid, yet environmentally sound urban growth. The results illuminated multiple inconsistencies (e.g., spatial conflicts) between urban and regional plans, most prominently stemming from conflicts in administrative boundaries and a lack of interdepartmental coordination. Key findings identified a lack of Strategic Environmental Assessment and inadequate implementation of land use plans caused by e.g., insufficient funding, lack of political will, political interference, corruption as challenges facing land use planning strategies for urban and environmental sustainability.

With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs)—certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies—most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.","tags":["ZDC"],"title":"Have food supply chain policies improved forest conservation and rural livelihoods?

Using an integrated approach, we mapped priority areas for allocating a fraction of MT recovery target to eligible public lands (1Mha) and private lands with forest deficits according to the BFC (1Mha). We estimated the costs and benefits of forest recovery for four scenarios, built varying the relative importance of four key criteria (habitat enhancement, carbon storage, opportunity costs of agriculture and likelihood of natural forest regeneration). Solely prioritizing habitat enhancement (scenario B100) improved the representation of species with highly disturbed habitats, while leveling the weights across criteria (scenario EW) yielded uniform enhancement across species. Conversely, EW costed 23% less than B100 (US$1.9 billion by 2030) and sequestered 27% more carbon (114.7 TgCO2e by 2030). In all scenarios, private properties were key to enhance intensively deforested habitats, while restoration in public lands was more effective in reducing costs and mitigating carbon.

Insufficient data about urban expansion hinders effective land use planning. Therefore, a high need to collect, process, and disseminate land cover data exists.

We applied a supervised classification of land cover of LANDSAT data from 1987, 2002, and 2017. We mapped land cover transitions from 1987 to 2017 and computed the net land cover change during this time. Finally, we analyzed the mismatches between the past and current urban land cover and land use plans and quantified the non-urban development area lost to urban/built-up. Our results indicated an increase in urban/built-up and bare land cover types, while vegetation land cover decreased. We observed mismatches between past/current land cover and the existing land use plan. By providing detailed insights into mismatches between the regional land use plan and unregulated urban expansion, this study provides important information for a critical debate on the role and effectiveness of land use planning for environmental sustainability and sustainable urban development, particularly in less developed countries.","tags":["Urban"],"title":"Land Cover Change in the Abuja City-Region, Nigeria - Integrating GIS and Remotely Sensed Data to Support Land Use Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philippe Rufin","Florian Gollnow","Daniel Müller","Patrick Hostert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546905600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546905600,"objectID":"3ef62fe96d6a80992adea04a86c21057","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/rufin_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rufin_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Widespread deforestation in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, has produced negative environmental outcomes of global reach. Now, MT has committed to partly offset this impact through the allocation of 2.9Mha of forest recovery statewide, motivated by the expectation of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) enforcement. Using an integrated approach, we mapped priority areas for allocating a fraction of MT recovery target to eligible public lands (1Mha) and private lands with forest deficits according to the BFC (1Mha). We estimated the costs and benefits of forest recovery for four scenarios, built varying the relative importance of four key criteria (habitat enhancement, carbon storage, opportunity costs of agriculture and likelihood of natural forest regeneration). Solely prioritizing habitat enhancement (scenario B100) improved the representation of species with highly disturbed habitats, while leveling the weights across criteria (scenario EW) yielded uniform enhancement across species. Conversely, EW costed 23% less than B100 (US$1.9 billion by 2030) and sequestered 27% more carbon (114.7 TgCO2e by 2030). In all scenarios, private properties were key to enhance intensively deforested habitats, while restoration in public lands was more effective in reducing costs and mitigating carbon. Our results stress that the BFC enforcement is crucial for increasing species representativity in highly deforested areas, but also revealed opportunities for cost-effective restoration across the state.","tags":["Other"],"title":"Synthesizing dam-induced land system change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Gollnow","Leticia de Barros Viana Hissa","Philippe Rufin","Tobia Lakes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"7f2caca3fe2c010896eba444162bb650","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/gollnow_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gollnow_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Brazil’s Soy Moratorium solidified the world’s largest traders’ commitment to stop soybean purchases from production areas deforested after July 2006. The aim was to remove deforestation from the soybean supply-chain and halt one of the main drivers of forest loss in the Amazon biome. In this study, we investigated changes in deforestation at the property-level for the period 2004 to 2014. The objective was to examine direct and indirect deforestation, defined as on-property displacement and cross-parcel displacement deforestation for soybean expansion in the Amazon region of Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state of the Brazilian Amazon. We used publicly available property and land use data to quantify deforestation associated with cropland expansion. Similar to previous studies, we found that direct deforestation for soybean expansion declined following the implementation of the Soy Moratorium. Moreover, our analysis suggest that indirect deforestation occurred already before the implementation of the Soy Moratorium, and decreased following the first period of analyses. However, slight increases of indirect deforestation in the more recent periods, combined with decreasing direct deforestations rendered indirect deforestation to be responsible for more than half of the deforestation associated with soybean expansion. While we acknowledge the overall reduction of deforestation for soybean, our results suggest, given the increasing trends of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2013, to address indirect deforestation within the Soy Moratorium. This may be achieved by zero-property-deforestation commitments and by strengthening the integration between supply-chain actors, the soybean and beef purchasing companies and the federal policies aiming to control deforestation.","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Property-level direct and indirect deforestation for soybean production in the Amazon region of Mato Grosso, Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Philipp Schägner","Luke Brander","Maria Luisa Paracchini","Joachim Maes","Florian Gollnow","Bastian Bertzkya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"1af287d58cf40d688dfc59bba2f0cc03","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/schagner_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schagner_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates spatial determinants of recreational ecosystem service values by combining Geographic Information System (GIS) and meta-analysis, and by presenting the first review on meta-analysis studies in this field.

The objective is to provide a tool for improving the information basis for scientists and policy makers regarding the effects of global change and national environmental policies on land-use change and the resulting impacts on the loss of natural vegetation, greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological processes, and soil erosion within the region. For this purpose, the framework combines the regional land-use models, LandSHIFT and alucR, the farm-level model, MPMAS, and the MONICA crop model, with a set of environmental impact models that are operating at the regional and watershed levels. As a first application of the framework, four scenarios with the time horizon 2030 were specified and analysed. Future land-use change will strongly depend on the interplay between the production of agricultural commodities, the agricultural intensification in terms of increasing crop yields and pasture biomass productivity, and the enforcement of environmental laws and policies. On the regional level, the scenarios with the highest increase in agricultural production in combination with weak law enforcement (Trend and Illegal Intensification) generated the highest losses in natural vegetation due to the expansion of agricultural area as well as the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Also, at the watershed level, these scenarios are characterised by the highest changes in river discharge and soil erosion that might lead to a further decline in soil fertility in the long term. Moreover, the analysis of the Sustainable Development scenario indicates that a shift in agricultural production patterns from livestock to crop cultivation, together with effective law enforcement, can effectively reduce land-use change and its negative effects on the environment. With the scenario analysis, we could illustrate that our assessment framework is capable to provide a large variety of valuable information to support the development of future land-use strategies in the study region.","tags":["PhD"],"title":"A model-based assessment of the environmental impact of land-use change across scales in Southern Amazonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Regine Schönenberg","Rüdiger Schaldach","Tobia Lakes","Jan Göpel","Florian Gollnow"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"83d368814daeba35e068255af9d09d0a","permalink":"https://floriangollnow.github.io/publication/schoneberg_et_al_2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schoneberg_et_al_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Our aim with this paper is to present a novel approach for developing story lines and scenarios by combining qualitative knowledge and quantitative data from different disciplines and discussing the results with relevant decision makers.

After decades of diverse policy interventions the question arises - What can we learn from past trajectories for a more sustainable development in the future? To answer this question, we combined qualitative story lines for the region, reviewed by local experts, with quantitative land-use scenarios, to study their regional and local manifestations in space.

Cattle ranching and soy expansion constitute the major drivers of deforestation, both through direct conversion and indirectly by land use displacement. However, deforestation rates decreased significantly after the implementation of the action plan to prevent and control deforestation in 2004. The aim of this study is to quantify the contribution of cattle and soy production with deforestation before and after the implementation of the action plan in the two states Mato Grosso and Pará along the BR-163. Specifically, we aim to empirically test for land use displacement processes from soy expansion in Mato Grosso to the deforestation frontier between 2001 and 2012. First, we calculated the relationships between deforestation rate and the change in cattle head and planted soy area respectively for the BR-163 region. Second, we estimated different panel regression models to test the association between processes of land use displacement. Our results indicate a close linkage between cattle ranching and deforestation along the BR-163 between 2001 and 2004. Soy expansion in Mato Grosso was significantly associated with deforestation during this period. However, these relations have diminished after the implementation of the action plan to control and prevent deforestation. With the decrease in deforestation rates in 2005, cattle ranching and deforestation were not directly linked, nor was soy expansion in Mato Grosso and deforestation at the forest frontier. Our analysis hence suggests that there was a close coupling of processes and spatial displacement until 2004 and a decoupling has taken place following the political interventions. These findings improve the understanding of land use displacement processes in Brazil and the methods offer potential for exploring similar processes in different regions of the world.","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Policy change, land use, and agriculture - The case of soy production and cattle ranching in Brazil, 2001–2012","type":"publication"}]

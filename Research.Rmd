### Zero-deforestation commitments
I am interested in the potentials and impacts of companies zero-deforestation (ZD) supply-chain commitments for ecosystem conservation and rural livelihoods. This work is 
embedded within the larger ZD research done in collaboration with ETH Zurich @  [zerodeforestationimpacts.com](http://zerodeforestationimpacts.com/). 
I focus on ZD commitments in the Brazilian soybean sector. My main interest is to understand the effectiveness of these commitments on reducing deforestation for commodity expansion. We evaluate ZDs spatial coverage, adoption biases and their combined effect on reducing commodity driven deforestation. To do so, we use spatial and econometric analysis and synthesizes data on commitments, production, trade, land use and land use change.

### Socioecological transformations in the Republic of Georgia
Georgia’s modern history has been characterized by multiple stark institutional changes. Containing large parts of the Caucasus biome, Georgia is heavily forested and contains high levels of biodiversity and endemism. This research aims to answer how institutional changes and globalization affect land use and land cover change and rural livelihoods. Scenario modeling will evaluate different conservation and development pathways to aid shape environmental policies.

### Land-use change and land-use displacement dynamics in Brazil (Ph.D. Theses)
Demands for agricultural commodities are a major threat for some of the most valuable ecosystems in the world. The expansion of the agricultural sector in Brazil, fueled by global demands for soybeans, contributed to the loss of tropical and savanna ecosystems. However, most deforestation was caused by pastures, raising concerns about land use displacement processes between soybean expansion and cattle ranching. Promising, reductions of deforestation were observed following the implementation of governmental strategies and zero-deforestation supply chain commitments. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of soybean expansion and cattle ranching, driving deforestation in one of the most dynamic agricultural expansion and deforestation frontier of Brazil, in Mato Grosso and Pará. In this region, land use displacement describes the conversion of pasture to soybean followed by deforestation for cattle ranching at another location. This process was assessed at regional and property-level. Moreover, scenario analysis was applied to identify regional and subregional dynamics of land use changes. The results indicated that environmental governance affected regional and local land use dynamics and displacement processes. Distal displacement processes between soybean expansion and deforestation were significant, contributing to deforestation, but declined subsequently to the implementation of environmental policies. Likewise, deforestation at property-level declined following the policy implementations. However, the effectiveness of the zero-deforestation supply chain commitment was found to be at risk due to property-level displacement deforestation. Additionally, the scenario analysis emphasized the importance of subregional dynamics and identified risks of future deforestation. Integrating efforts between supply chain (soy and cattle) and governmental actors may be crucial to reduce deforestation in the Amazon.

### Environmental challenges of urban land use planing under rapid urban expansion in Abuja, Nigeria.
Lead by Evidence Chinedu Enoguanbhor this project focused on environmental challenges of urban land use planing in Abuja, Nigeria. Rapid urban expansion, a lack of timely land use information and technical and financial resources, challenge land use planing in many Sub-Saharan African city-regions. Here we identify current trends, potential future developments and challenges of current land use planing practices, relevant for achieving a more sustainable urban development.

title: Using internet search data to understand information seeking behavior for health and conservation topics during the COVID-19 pandemic  
  
abstract: Emerging zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19, exist at the intersection of human health and the environment. Public interest and support are required to maximize the effectiveness of policies to combat the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks of zoonoses. Here, we use internet search data from the United States to investigate changes in public information seeking about topics at the intersection of health and the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using breakpoint detection methods, we identify sharp increases in interest for ‘wildlife trade’, ‘bats’, and ‘pangolins’ in the early stages of the pandemic (on Jan. 12, Jan. 19, and Jan. 26, 2020, respectively). Network analyses also revealed increasing connectivity between terms related to human health and the environment, as well as the emergence of novel search terms pointing to a greater interest in wildlife trade and consumption. During the pandemic, the network connectivity between coronavirus keywords and conservation keywords increased, which we measured using the number of unique connections (edge connectivity, k′ (G)) and the number of simple paths (Sp) between keywords. Both measures of network connectivity increased between ‘coronavirus’ and ‘bats’ or ‘pangolins’ (Δk′ (G) = 1, ΔSp = 37), and between ‘coronavirus’ and ‘conservation’ (Δk′ (G) = 1, ΔSp = 160). These findings suggest that policy and outreach efforts aimed at engaging public interest in intersectional approaches to pandemic prevention (e.g., One Health, Planetary Health), may be able to take advantage of increases in public information seeking following catalyzing events during the pandemic. Further monitoring is needed to determine if these changes persist over time.

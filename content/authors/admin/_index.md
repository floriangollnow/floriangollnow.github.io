I am interested in the impact of environmental policies on nature conservation, agricultural development, and livelihoods. Currently, I investigate the effects of corporate zero-deforestation supply chain commitments in the Brazilian soybean sector. With this work, I contribute to a more precise understanding of current initiatives for forest conservation, and the development of more effective policies to reduce tropical deforestation. 
In my work, I apply spatial analysis, econometric modeling, and statistics to analyze large spatial and temporal datasets.    
  
I received my Ph.D. from [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en) where I investigated interactions of land-use change (i.e., soybean and cattle ranching), environmental policies, and tropical deforestation in Brazil. Following, I was awarded a two-year Postdoctoral-Fellowship at the [Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/), University of Maryland. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Environmental Policy Lab (EPL) at ETH Zürich](https://epl.ethz.ch/) working in collaboration with the [Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/earth/).

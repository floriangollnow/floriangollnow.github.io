---

Lead by Evidence Chinedu Enoguanbhor this project focused on environmental challenges of urban land use planing in Abuja, Nigeria. Rapid urban expansion, a lack of timely land use information and technical and financial resources, challenge land use planing in many Sub-Saharan African city-regions. Here we identify current trends, potential future developments and challenges of current land use planing practices, relevant for achieving a more sustainable urban development.
